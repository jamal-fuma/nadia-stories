Title:  The Princess and the

Once apon a time there was a princess who loved going into the garden barefoot.
She never ever brought her shoes with her.,

Her Dad the King loved eating his dinner outside so he could watch his Princess play in the garden.

One day when she went downstairs out of the castle, she stepped in poop, and said 'Oh dear, I stepped in poo.'
The guards where always there to watch her and they still where.

The guards heard her scream and asked 'Princess, Princess, what happened?' And the Princess said, 'I stepped in poop!'.

The guards took her upstairs and got her all cleaned up, after that she went back into the garden still in bare feet.


A bird, pooped on her head, and she went back in side to get cleaned up with the guards again.
The guards told the King about the two poopings, the King declared that from now on there would be no pooping allowed in the Kingdom.
The guards protested but the King said 'Shush, no ifs or buts, that is the new rule'.
